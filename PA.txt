In 2023, I found immense satisfaction in achieving noteworthy technical milestones, both in terms of the outcomes and the methodologies employed. My role encompassed providing crucial architectural support and subject matter expertise to senior technical managers while collaborating closely with developers to offer technical insights and resolve challenges. This collaborative effort aimed to eliminate technical debt and bolster the ECR business.

One of the highlights of the year was spearheading cutting-edge AI/ML proof-of-concepts in tandem with the business, showcasing technological excellence to address pertinent business issues. Simultaneously, I engaged with the MDE on the AI tollgate for diverse use cases, contributing to a holistic technical landscape. My involvement in Blueprint refresh initiatives alongside Enterprise Architecture and business teams underscored my commitment to refining our technological foundations.

A critical deliverable involved remediating Documentation SIAI, where I devised a creative design approach to leverage existing documentation while ensuring long-term sustainability. Presenting these innovative ideas to principal engineers and senior tech managers, and guiding feature teams in their adoption required effective collaboration and communication. My strategy involved incorporating macros for automation to make documentation updates transparent to stakeholders.

Conducting design reviews for Risk Framework applications and Retail risk applications showcased my commitment to preventing potential issues and ensuring robust design principles. Additionally, my technical expertise played a pivotal role in the successful migration of the VSIMS Platform, addressing longstanding vulnerabilities in our only external-facing application in a timely manner.

Throughout the year, I seamlessly transitioned between roles, serving as a Solution Architect, Senior Engineer, and Principal Engineer as dictated by the evolving needs of the teams I collaborated with. I am sincerely grateful to the management for affording me the unique opportunity to collaborate with senior tech managers, feature leads, fellow principal engineers, architects, and developers across the portfolio.

Earning the trust of developers, feature leads, and tech managers has been a source of great pride for me, as it reinforces my commitment to being a reliable resource for addressing technical challenges. As I reflect on the accomplishments of 2023, I am eager and motivated to continue this trajectory of success in the upcoming year.
