What version of sqlite3 approved for use?
Can i install sqlite?
Does R../e..w/QL.t have the capacity to use sqlite at runtime for validating the data for icvs etc?


Check with Rao if the problem of unittest for sql is resolved
Are integrity constraint violations still a dq issue in exadata and hadoop? Can we use logica/datalog to identify icvs?
Are there any manual repairs happening done by business? Can we bring tools to automate the repairs?
